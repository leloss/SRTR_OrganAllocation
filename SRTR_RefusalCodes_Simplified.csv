837,837 Organ-specific reasons
850,850 Potential recipient was bypassed for priority multi-organ transplant
851,851 Potential recipient was bypassed because the donation was directed to a specific recipient.

853,"853 Potential recipient was bypassed due to the OPO''s OPTN-approved alternative local unit, sharing agreement, or variance"
860,860 Center bypassed potential recipient due to the urgent medical needs of another potential recipient. (Requires written verification by the transplant program to UNOS Policy Compliance Department.) (Also requires written verification by OPO to UNOS Policy Compliance Department; this bypass and narrative justification will be shared with bypassed centers.)

(Requires written verification by OPO to UNOS Policy Compliance Department; this bypass and narrative justification will be shared with bypassed centers.)"
862,862 Potential recipient was bypassed due to urgent donor organ placement. (Requires written verification by OPO to UNOS Policy Compliance Department; this bypass and narrative justification will be shared with bypassed centers.)
863,863 PTR bypassed: offer made during an expedited placement attempt
880,880 Potential recipient was bypassed in order to place the kidney with the extra-renal organ recipient from the same donor.
881,881 Potential recipient was bypassed and not offered zero mismatch organs because the policy requirement was satisfied prior to this sequence number.
